This is a script to sum all of the points that a team has scored, including their bench, throughout the regular fantasy football season and is intended to be used after a league has finished the regular season.
It does not take into account players that are on a team's taxi squad, only the players on the main roster. 
In order to run this program you will also need to have the sleeper-api-wrapper downloaded which can be found at the following repository
